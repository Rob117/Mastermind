The spec: 

Build it out so that the computer will guess if you decide to choose your own secret colors. 
Start by having the computer guess randomly (but keeping the ones that match exactly).
Next, add a little bit more intelligence to the computer player so that, if the computer has guessed the right color but the wrong position, 
its next guess will need to include that color somewhere. Feel free to make the AI even smarter.

Current issue: answer code is being accessed and deleted during guess check
